I am a postdoctoral researcher at Boise State University where I work within the Spatial Analysis of Social Ecological Systems  [(**SPASES**)]([https://www.spaseslab.com/]).  Broadly speaking, I am interested in the direct and indirect ways in which environmental policies (attention, laws, and regulation) can impact land surface processes, specifically for forested ecosystems.

  - A spatial analysis of the time to complete environmental impact assessments in the United States Forest Service (USFS)
