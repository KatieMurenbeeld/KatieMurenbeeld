### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a PhD candidate at Boise State University where I work within the Lab for Ecohydrological Applications and Forecasting (**LEAF**). I am interested in the interdisciplinary work of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the direct and indirect ways in which environmental and energy policy (attention, laws, and regulation) can impact land surface processes, specifically for forested ecosystems.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
-- defending my dissertation "Deviating from the Plan: Assessing the Impact of Forest Management Delays on Forest Structure and Function" 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
-- How to build a website through codeacademy
-- Machine learning through the Radiant MLHub 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: katiemurenbeeld@u.boisestate.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a huge Georgia football fan. Go DAWGS!
