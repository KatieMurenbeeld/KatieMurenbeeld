### Hello!


I am a PhD candidate at Boise State University where I work within the Lab for Ecohydrological Applications and Forecasting [(**LEAF**)](https://www.boisestate.edu/leaf/). I work in Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the direct and indirect ways in which environmental and energy policy (attention, laws, and regulation) can impact land surface processes, specifically for forested ecosystems.

In my research I have: 
 1. Quantified temporal aspects of forest management in the western US with a focus on project delays
 2. Used the project delay data to inform multiple logging scenarios within a land surface model (the [Community Terrestrial Systems Model](http://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM) with [FATES](http://github.com/NGEET/fates)) 
 3. Worked to parameterize the land surface model for use in temperate, evergreen forests
