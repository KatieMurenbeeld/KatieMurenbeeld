### Hi there 👋


I am a PhD candidate at Boise State University where I work within the Lab for Ecohydrological Applications and Forecasting [(**LEAF**)](https://www.boisestate.edu/leaf/). I am interested in the interdisciplinary work of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the direct and indirect ways in which environmental and energy policy (attention, laws, and regulation) can impact land surface processes, specifically for forested ecosystems.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: 
  - defending my dissertation "Deviating from the Plan: Assessing the Impact of Forest Management Delays on Forest Structure and Function" 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - How to build a website through codeacademy
  - Machine learning through the Radiant MLHub 
- 📫 How to reach me: katiemurenbeeld@u.boisestate.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a huge Georgia football fan 🏈 Go DAWGS!
